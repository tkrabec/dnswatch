# dnswatch
dnswatch takes dns data, compares it to a local known good file as well as the Alexa top1m or other similarly formatted file, then spits out domains that are not in those as domains to do more research on

Special thanks to Mark Baggett for thr origional inspiration with domain_watcher.py 
And to Adian Reich for the initial code I've been modifying.
